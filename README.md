I'm a computer science student at the University of Basel. In this repository I've put together some documents I've worked on in my university projects. The documents of the projects **Rat um Rad** and **EasterEgg-Hunt** were created in group projects. Although I was responsible for the biggest part of the documents, I was not the only contributor. These documents are a compromise of the ideas and contributions of every group member.

Nevertheless, I revised all documents to make them closer to my ideas, especially in terms of precision, terminology and consistency. For data protection reasons, I have removed the names of the other team members.
